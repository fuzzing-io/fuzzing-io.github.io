This is the README for dltrace, a dynamic library call 
tracer package. The concepts in this package were discussed in the interz0ne 2005 security conference
presentation titled "Automated Debugging and Process Analysis"
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
dltrace is a dynamic library call tracer which attempts to remain portable to
all x86 platforms that support ELF binaries and expose a debugging interface
via procfs or the ptrace() system call. The shared library call tracing is done
at a level which allows all calls to all exported symbols by all loaded
libraries to be traced. In addition, dltrace does not rely on rtld symbols to
retrieve library and symbol information and is capable of determing function
arguments dynamically via run-time disassembly.
<br /><br />
dltrace's functionality is somewhat similar to ltrace, however there are many
differences under the hood. The most noticable difference is that dltrace is
capable of tracing all calls to exported functions, regardless of how deep the
call chain is. This is done by placing hooks directly at the entry point of
each exported function, rather than at the calling address in the .text segment
of the main executable program. The calling address can be determined by
examining the frame pointer, so there is no need to break on the calling
address. This also gives the advantage of determining the underlying
functionality of unknown functions in the traced binary or in custom libraries
that are linked by the traced binary. This works on stripped binaries as well
since only symbols exported by shared libraries are needed for the trace. 
<br /><br />
Another unique feature in dltrace is the lack of reliance on a specifc rtld.
Due to changes in the gnu run-time linker, the author has chosen not to rely on
specific structures such as the link_map which is no longer exported by new
versions of ld-linux. A new method has been chosen which may seem somewhat of a
hack, however it works well and allows the tracer to be rtld agnostic. The new
method is fairly simple: the traced process's address space is walked by
PAGE_SIZE, when an elf signature is found ("\x7fELF") a hash is taken of the
file's .text segment and compared to hashes which have been taken from the
on-disk copies of all libraries linked by the traced executable. 
<br /><br />
The last feature is a rudimentary heuristics based approach to determining a
function's arguments. This removes the reliance on pre-defined function
prototypes and can allow for the discovery of call parameters to unknown
functions. There's not much to be said about the methods used right now. A
simple run-time disassembly of the calling function checks for mov's and push's
which are likely to be arguments. 
<br /><br />
dltrace was developed during research for a talk at interz0ne 2005 on automated
debug tool design. The slides are available on labs.idefense.com and can be
consulted for further documentation on the methods used in dltrace.

USAGE 
<pre>
Usage: ./dltrace [OPTIONS] -- [file path] [args ...]
  -p pid       attach to process id (file path required)

Trace Options
  -l           trace library calls
  -d depth     limit trace recursion depth

Output Options
  -r           display registers (use multiple times)
  -t           tree mode 
  -v           verbose (use multiple times)
  -o file      write trace output to file 

Example:
  dltrace -l  -- /usr/bin/last 5
  dltrace -l -d5 -t -- /bin/ping localhost
  dltrace -l -d3 -rr -vv -- /usr/bin/id 
</pre>
<br /><br />
TESTING
<br /><br />
dltrace has been confirmed to work on Linux, Solaris x86, NetBSD, and FreeBSD
at one time or another.  It has been tested against various libc versions and
does not rely on rtld structures to find symbols and loaded libraries, so it
should work with all combinations of compilers and linkers. One caveat is that
the simple heursitics used in this version of dltrace may not detect arguments
to functions which have been highly optimized. The author hopes to address this
issue in the next release. 
<br /><br />
Any testing feedback would be highly appreciated. Other comments and feature
requests are welcome. This version of dltrace is considered to be a work in
progress and a more complete, faster, and accurate dltrace is planned for
release this summer.
